This is a simple laptop game called Simon game which I built and used to improve my skill on JavaScript. 
The game is played by following patterns created by random numbers, missing a pattern would end the game.
This game helped me understad arrays, objects and functions as well as how to efficiently use the jQuery library in my code.
Enjoy the game and try to beat my highscoreðŸ˜œ (level 15). 
Have fun!
